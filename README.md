## Learning GANs

This repository is a little collection on learning how to use different GANs on MNIST with Keras. Code is partly adapted from Renu Khandelwal [0], Rowel Atienza [1], Jason Bronwlee [2]. Work in progress.



#### TODO:

- ~~Dense GAN~~
- ~~CNN GAN~~
- Conditional GAN
- Progressive GANs
- Visualisation
- Fix mode collapse



#### Occurring Problems:

- Partial mode collapse. Generator tends to generate the similar output or output containing similar features. Fixes:

- Identify point of convergence
